python run_app.py
```

The script will:
- ✓ Check MongoDB connection
- ✓ Create necessary directories
- ✓ Check environment variables
- ✓ Run database migrations
- ✓ Start the Django server

## Manual Installation

1. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Set up environment variables**
```bash
# Create .env file with:
COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key-here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/
MONGODB_DB_NAME=cv_platform
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
```

4. **Ensure MongoDB is running**
```bash
# Windows: MongoDB service should be running
# Linux/Mac: sudo systemctl start mongod
```

5. **Run the startup script**
```bash
python run_app.py
```

6. **Access the application**
- Web interface: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
- Admin panel: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/

## MongoDB Setup

**Important**: This application uses MongoDB as the primary database (not SQLite).

Make sure MongoDB is running on your system:

```bash
# On Windows (if installed as service, it should start automatically)
# Or start manually:
mongod

# On Linux/Mac:
sudo systemctl start mongod
# or
mongod
```

The application will automatically connect to MongoDB using the `MONGODB_URI` from your `.env` file.

## Language Support

The application supports **Arabic (العربية)** and **English**:

- Language switcher is available in the navigation bar
- All pages automatically adjust text direction (RTL for Arabic, LTR for English)
- Translations can be extended by editing files in `locale/` directory

To add more translations:
```bash
python create_translations.py
# Edit .po files in locale/
python cv_platform/manage.py compilemessages
```
